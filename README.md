The Roadmap for the Future
I would like to incorporate several different eye styles or art styles and then various facial expressions to go along with each, and eventually have several different combinations that can be enabled with options that change automatically with the click of a button. It would also be worth adding this as an interactive emoji "tablet" or widget to which people could collaborate on facial expression in some way by sharing the same running instance of this.
